Load the requirements file before running the jupiter notebook.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To do all the code in the notebook, a desktop with a GPU is recommended, it would still take around 4 hours. However, I've cached many of the models and predictions so running the notebook should not take around 20 minutes.
